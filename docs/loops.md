# Loops

Sutra has four looping constructs: `loop`, `while`, `do`/`while`, and `foreach`. Each compiles to one of two patterns:

- **Compile-time unroll** — the loop body is emitted once per iteration directly into the output, no loop exists at runtime.
- **Eigenrotation** — the loop state is rotated by a fixed matrix each step; termination is a prototype-match test in vector space. The brain (or GPU tensor code) iterates; Python doesn't.

Which pattern a given loop uses is determined by whether the iteration count is known at compile time.

## `loop(N)` — compile-time unroll

```c
loop (3) {
    x = x + step;
}
```

When `N` is an integer literal, the body is emitted three times:

```python
x = x + step
x = x + step
x = x + step
```

No runtime loop. No iteration counter on the host. The emitted code is straight-line and the compiler can simplify across the copies.

### With an index

```c
loop (3 as i) {
    use(i);
}
```

The index variable `i` takes values `0, 1, 2`. Emits a real `for i in range(3)` when the count isn't a pure literal, otherwise unrolls.

Use `loop(N)` for small fixed repetitions — stacking a few transformations, generating a short codebook, initializing a banks. It's syntactic sugar over straight-line code.

### The `iterator` reserved keyword

Inside an unrolling loop with a compile-time-constant bound (`loop (N) { ... }` where `N` is an integer literal), the keyword `iterator` refers to the current iteration's index without needing an `as i` binding.

```c
var n : int = 0;
loop (5) {
    n += iterator;
}
// n == 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 == 15
```

The compiler unrolls and substitutes `iterator` with the per-copy constant — **1-based, ranging from 1 to N**:

```c
n += 1;
n += 2;
n += 3;
n += 4;
n += 5;
```

`iterator` is **never a runtime variable**. Each unrolled copy gets a different compile-time constant. The keyword is contextual — only meaningful inside an unrolling `loop (N)` body where N is a literal — and a compile-time error elsewhere (including inside `loop (N as i)`, where you should reference `i` instead, and inside `loop (cond)` eigenrotation loops).

In nested unrolled loops, `iterator` always binds to the innermost surrounding loop. The outer value is saved across the inner loop's unroll and restored after.

This is the language's canonical demonstration of "Sutra has no memory points": where C's `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)` puts `i` in memory and mutates it, Sutra's `loop (5) { n += iterator; }` substitutes five different compile-time constants and emits straight-line code with nothing to point at. See [paradigms](paradigms.md) § Imperative — C for the wider framing.

**Coexistence with `loop (N as i)`:** both forms are accepted. `as i` lets you choose the name (useful for nested loops that want the outer index in scope inside the inner body, since `iterator` always rebinds to the innermost). `iterator` is the always-available default. They don't conflict — a loop body can use either or both.

**Open question — `foreach`:** whether `iterator` should also work inside `foreach (x in [a, b, c])` (substituting the *element* rather than an index) is undecided. The unroll mechanism is the same; the question is what `iterator` should mean. Logged under `todo.md`.

## `loop(condition)` — eigenrotation

```c
loop (x.truth() > 0.5) {
    x = step(x);
}
```

When the loop header is a condition (not an integer), the loop compiles to a **geometric rotation** on the state vector with termination by prototype match:

1. Compile the body to a single rotation matrix `R`.
2. Compile the condition into a codebook of target prototypes.
3. Emit `_VSA.loop(state, R, prototypes)` — the runtime applies `R` to the state, checks against the prototypes, and terminates when the match crosses a threshold.

The iteration happens on the substrate. Python does not see the loop counter. The loop terminates because the rotated state enters the target prototype's basin, not because a host counter hit a limit. There's a `max_iters` safety cap in the runtime, but the semantic terminator is the prototype match.

This is the form that makes Sutra effectively a linear bounded automaton rather than just a feedforward circuit — runtime-conditional iteration over runtime-evolving state.

---

## `while(cond)` — same eigenrotation machinery

```c
while (x.truth() > 0.5) {
    x = step(x);
}
```

Semantically identical to `loop(condition)`. Kept as a keyword because people coming from C-family languages reach for `while` first. Compiles through the same `_translate_while_as_geometric_loop` path.

---

## `do { body } while (cond)` — desugars

```c
do {
    x = step(x);
} while (x.truth() > 0.5);
```

Desugars to: body executes once, then a `while (cond) { body }`. The while half compiles to eigenrotation. The desugar happens at the AST level — there's no do-while-specific runtime.

---

## `for(init; cond; step)` — bounded geometric loop

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = step(x);
}
```

Compiles to a **bounded** eigenrotation loop. The bound (`i < 10`) is extracted at compile time, and the rotation is pre-scaled so `N` iterations equals the intended total angle. Emits `for i in range(N): …` around a rotation application.

The structure is the same as `loop(N)` in spirit — fixed count, no runtime termination test — but with the geometric-rotation semantic that the brain expects.

---

## `foreach(x in [a, b, c])` — compile-time expansion over array literals

```c
foreach (step in [step_a, step_b, step_c]) {
    x = step(x);
}
```

When the iterable is a compile-time-known array literal, the body is emitted once per element with `step` substituted. Three calls in straight line, no runtime iteration. This is how Sutra writes out a fixed sequence of operations that would be a for-each-item loop in other languages.

`foreach` over a runtime-known array (not a literal) is not currently supported — the array has to be known at compile time so the unrolling can happen.

---

## Choosing between them

| you want | use |
|---|---|
| N fixed at compile time, small | `loop(N)` |
| N fixed, need the index | `loop(N as i)` |
| iterate a fixed list of items | `foreach(x in [...])` |
| iterate until a state converges | `loop(condition)` or `while(condition)` |
| do-at-least-once with a continue-condition | `do { } while` |
| C-style three-part index loop | `for(init; cond; step)` |

The common theme: loops that unroll at compile time stay straight-line in the emitted code and let the compiler simplify across iterations. Loops that depend on runtime state evolve the state via rotation and terminate by prototype match.
