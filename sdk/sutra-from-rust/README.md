# sutra-from-rust

Rust → Sutra transpiler frontend (MVP). Models on `sutra-from-ocaml` (the
reference frontend). `lower(source)` turns Rust source into Sutra source;
fixtures are verified **compile-AND-run on the substrate** (the OCaml harness
bar), not compile-only.

## Status

As of 2026-06-12: top-level `fn` items with typed parameters + returns
(i8…i64/u8…u64/usize/isize → int, f32/f64 → number, bool → bool); block bodies
with `let` bindings and a tail expression; integer/float literals with numeric
suffixes stripped; binary arithmetic/comparison/boolean operators; `if/else`
expressions → the defuzz blend; calls; parens; **algebraic `enum`s + `match` →
tagged axons** (the OCaml variant pattern: the enum erases to a tag/arity
prepass; the enum name maps to `Axon` in param/return types; construction
`E::V(a, b)` hoists to `Axon t; t.add("_tag", …); t.add("_val0", a); …`; a
`match` on an enum param binds `_vtag`/`_val{i}` to clean number-vector locals
first — the inline repeated `realvec(...)` reads do not project crisply,
measured 3.5 vs 2 — then blends by tag with the payload names substituted, the
last arm the exhaustive base). A `match` may appear **nested in a larger
expression** (e.g. `100 + match e { … }`), not only as the function tail: the
nested match is hoisted to collision-free binding locals (`_vtag_hN`/`_val_hN_i`)
emitted before the statement, and its blend expr is substituted at the use site
(the `_ARG_HOIST` mechanism, shared with construction hoisting). Substrate-
verified: `nested_match` = 202 (`evalE e = 100 + match e { Lit n => n, Neg n => 0
- n }`; `evalE(Lit 7)` = 107 + `evalE(Neg 5)` = 95). Substrate-verified: `add_main` = 16,
`if_classify` = 100, `let_block` = 17, `enum_match` = 2 (`eval(Expr::Lit 7) +
eval(Expr::Neg 5)`, with a `Pair(a, b)` multi-arg arm), `tail_rec` = 15
(tail-recursive `fn f(p…) { if COND { BASE } else { f(a…) } }` → a declared
`while_loop`, the OCaml/Scala/F# shape; non-tail recursion stays
`UNSUPPORTED-RECURSION`), `nontail_fact` = 120 (foldable non-tail recursion
`LEAF +|* f(REC)` → an accumulator `while_loop` trampoline, the OCaml CPS port;
param-dependent base cases are rejected, not mis-evaluated), `struct_axon` = 12
(**`struct`s → axons**, the OCaml record pattern: the struct def erases to a name
prepass; the struct name maps to `Axon`; `S { x: a, y: b }` constructs a
named-field axon — directly into a `let`, or hoisted to a temp in argument
position; field access `p.x` → `realvec(p.item("x"))`; numeric fields only).
**Field-init shorthand** `S { x, y }` is accepted as sugar for `S { x: x, y: y }`
(the in-scope local of the same name fills the field; substrate-verified
`struct_shorthand` = 13, `sum2(Point { x, y })` at `x=5, y=8`); `..base` spread
remains a later item.

As of 2026-06-13: **imperative `while` loops → substrate `while_loop`** (the
OCaml `_lower_while` shape). A `fn` body of leading `let [mut]` bindings, one or
more `while COND { lhs = rhs; … }` loops, and a bare tail expression lowers to a
hoisted `while_loop` + the `slot`/`loop`/write-back call sequence. The loop's
state is the in-scope names (locals + params) the condition/body touch, threaded
through the loop (the hoisted `while_loop` is top-level and sees only its params,
so params referenced in the loop are threaded read-only); only `mut` locals are
written back. Substrate-verified: `while_sum` = 15 (`let mut acc/i = 0; while i
< n { i = i + 1; acc = acc + i } acc`, `sum_to(5)`). **Loop bounds must use
strict `<` / `>`, not `<=` / `>=`:** at exact equality the substrate comparison
defuzzes false, so a `<=` bound drops the boundary iteration (measured: `<` →
15, `<=` → 10; finding `2026-06-13-while-loop-le-boundary-equality-defuzz`). The
OCaml reference frontend writes all its `while` fixtures with `<` for the same
reason.

As of 2026-06-15: **unbounded `loop { if COND { break; } BODY }` → substrate
`while_loop`** on the continue condition `!COND`. The single-leading-break shape
is the supported one — `loop { if C { break; } REST }` is exactly `while !C {
REST }`, so it reuses the `while` lowering with the halt-guard hoisted out and
negated (`_negate_cond`: a comparison inverts via its negated operator, e.g. `i
>= n` → `i < n`; otherwise `!(…)`). A `break` anywhere other than the leading
guard stays out of shape (falls through to the unsupported path). Substrate-
verified: `loop_break` = 15 (`loop { if i >= n { break; } acc = acc + i; i = i +
1 } acc`, `sum_to(6)` = 0+1+…+5). Because the negated halt condition becomes the
loop's strict comparison, the `<`/`<=` boundary-equality caveat above applies to
the *break* condition: write `if i >= n { break; }` (negates to strict `i < n`),
not `if i > n` (would negate to `<=` and overshoot).

Compound assignment (`x += rhs`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) is supported in `while`
bodies and at statement scope — it desugars to `x = (x op rhs)` (substrate-
verified `while_compound` = 15, the `+=` form of `while_sum`).

Ownership/borrowing never reaches the lowering at this scope; `&`/borrows,
`loop`/`break`, and non-tail/foldable-exempt recursion surface as `UNSUPPORTED-*`
markers (never a silent self-call). A `match` is supported as a function-body
tail; nested in a larger expression it is a later item.

Dependency: `tree-sitter-rust` (`pip install tree-sitter-rust`).

## Next

Statement-bearing if-arms; nullary-variant values; struct `..base` spread; a VARIANT
match nested in an expression / tail-arm (needs int-locals an expression can't emit);
NESTED `if let`. (A LITERAL match nested in a tail-match arm `A(x) => match n { 0 => x,
_ => x+1 }` inlines as a blend — `nested_match_tail_arm` = 5, shipped 2026-06-18. A Bool
`match b { true => …, false => … }` dispatches `(b == true)`/`(b == false)` — `bool_match`
= 10, shipped 2026-06-18.) (Unbounded `loop { … break }`, struct field-init shorthand,
and nested/non-tail `match` in expression position all shipped 2026-06-15. NESTED tuple
AND struct patterns (`let (a, (b, c)) = t`, `let Outer { a, inner: Inner { v } } = o`)
shipped 2026-06-17 — a shared `_emit_rust_nested_reads` emits an `Axon` temp per non-leaf
prefix so reads dispatch as `axon_item`, since chaining `.item()` on a raw tensor fails.
Function-tail enum `if let E::V(x) = s { … } else { … }` shipped 2026-06-17 — an
`int _vtag` round-trip makes the tag test crisp at tag 0.)
