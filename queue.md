# Sutra — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** It lists what is being worked on now
and what is next, in execution order — barrel it top to bottom. **Finished work is
REMOVED from this file in the same commit it ships** (history lives in `git log`,
`DEVLOG.md`, and `planning/findings/`). `todo.md` is longer-horizon; items migrate
`todo.md` → `queue.md` → deleted on completion.

**Big-leg order (Emma 2026-06-19): FV spectral-gap → Yantra OS → WASM.** FV spectral-gap
is SHIPPED (2026-06-19); the two remaining sections below are in execution order. Do them
top to bottom; do not start a lower one until the one above is shipped (or explicitly parked).

## Context (read first, do not work on)

- **`paper/paper.md` is UNFROZEN** (Emma 2026-06-07); `paper/neurips/` freeze RETIRED 2026-06-18.
  Measured numbers only; no overclaiming.
- **NEVER use `Math.mod`** (measured vector-collapse/NaN). Use complex rotation for wrap/periodic.
- **GUI is on Emma's SEPARATE branch** — OUT of this queue. Do NOT re-add GUI items.
- **Substrate purity is non-negotiable**: every op runs on the substrate, NO host readout
  (`.item()`/`float(tensor)`) inside operations.

## 1. Yantra OS integration — ACTIVE (FV spectral-gap shipped 2026-06-19)

Downstream consumer work: wire more of the Sutra substrate into the vendored `external/Yantra/` OS.
NOT YET DECOMPOSED — first action is to pull the concrete first step from `todo.md` § Yantra / the
GUI-substrate-surface pattern, decompose it into concrete steps HERE, mirror to the task tool, then
execute. (Division of responsibility + the substrate-window GUI pattern are in `CLAUDE.md`
§ "Cross-repo workflow"; the trainable click-button rides the pattern end-to-end already.)

---

## 2. WASM source frontend — NEXT (do after §1)

The `WASM/`-subtree source→Sutra path (Phase 3 in `todo.md`). Several sub-parts are CI/clang-blocked
on this clone (need `uv`/`clang`/`wat2wasm`); route those through CI. Decompose from `todo.md`
§"Phase 3 — WASM" + the `WASM/` agenda when §1 is done.

## Pointers

- Substrate-leak catalogue: `Audit.md`. Longer-horizon: `todo.md`. Findings: `planning/findings/`.
  Open design questions: `planning/open-questions/`. Devlog: `DEVLOG.md`.
- Transpiler edge cases (low-value, leave-on-WASM-fallback): `planning/wasm-fallback-edge-cases.md`.
- Corpus: `github.com/EmmaLeonhart/sutra-w2c-corpus` (submodule `corpus/`) + HF mirror.
- Yantra (downstream OS): vendored in-tree at `external/Yantra/`.

## Session bracket

- The autonomous loop is the self-timed `ScheduleWakeup` form (not the old three-cron playbook).
